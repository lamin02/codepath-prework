## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps: 
1) instagram
2) tiktok 
3) snapchat 

these apps are my favorite because instagram has direct DM's to talk with friends, you can add a note to your profile for others to see, and they have a tagged tab to show on your profile who has tagged you. As for tiktok, i also like the direct message feature to share tiktoks with friends and i like how you can create your own tiktoks. Lastly, for snapchat, I like how you can view others snaps and then slide up to send a reaction, sending a snap back to a friend is easy by double tapping, and having the streak feature.'

I would like to build an app for students who are trying to connect with others at college. It would include featurues such as requesting a schedule or some classes from the user, then connecting them to other people who are in the same course. Additionally i would have a feature where people can link their socials so people can friend each other on different apps. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- i noticed that sometimes the assistant for the editor did not show the file, so i had to link it so it could open up and i can control + drag the button insidde of the class
